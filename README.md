# SwitchingKeyboardsToken Visualizer

Hello Dear Programmer, We have deployed a contract with address:

`0x4F6adBC7F644647ed3425513A4EA0Fb22933eF37`

to the Testnet Ropsten Contract Address:

`0x3c460210d54f43b195d6c6ccec39d49b8f577785`
(Link)[https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x3c460210d54f43b195d6c6ccec39d49b8f577785#code]

This is the official token for the great cypher-punk extrodinaire SwitchingKeyboards.

We need a *one-page visualization* of this Token that demonstrates its totalSupply
and allows for a generic balanceOf call.  We have provided the address above
and in this repo, we have also included a contract ABI for web3.js access.

For this task, we require the spinning up of a *React* web frontend and our
lead frontend developer has requested that all data state is handled with *React-Redux*
for our future extensions.  

We also highly recommend using the web3.js library (Link: https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.3.4/)
for access.
